Welcome to the Self-Driving-Dataset-Workshop! In this jupyter notebook, we will cover working with ADAS datasets to load, visualize,and level up your ML workflows, all with the Open Source tool [FiftyOne](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone). You will need to download the `mini` split of NuScenes, found here: https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes?tutorial=nuscenes#download. You can also check out the NuScenes dataset inside FiftyOne online here: https://try.fiftyone.ai/datasets/nuscenes/samples
